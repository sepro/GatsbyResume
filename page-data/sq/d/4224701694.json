This goes hand in hand with using modern\n      (web) technology to create intuitive tools which allows domain experts to explore these data. Over the years I've been involved in the development \n      of various platforms to study genome evolution, gene function, and microbial ecosystems. These have been used in a number of projects e.g. the \n      Apple genome project, the Flemish Gut Flora Project, ...
