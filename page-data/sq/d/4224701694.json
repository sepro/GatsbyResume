Over the course of several PostDocs (<em>e.g.</em> at the <a href=\"https://www.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/2168/en\">Max \n      Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology</a>) I have ventured more and more towards software development, setting up web platforms to explore large datasets while\n      leveraging data science and machine learning methods to pick them apart further.</p>\n      \n      <p>Full bio available under <a href=\"./experience\">experience & education</a>.</p>\n\n      <h3>Research</h3>\n      <p>The common theme throughout my research is leveraging large datasets to tackle biological questions. This goes hand in hand with using modern\n      (web) technology to create intuitive tools which allows domain experts to explore these data. Over the years I've been involved in the development \n      of various platforms to study genome evolution, gene function, and microbial ecosystems. These have been used in a number of projects <em>e.g.</em> the \n      Apple genome project, the Flemish Gut Flora Project, ...
